### Technologies used
* Typescript
* Koa
* Axios
* Ava

### Motivation

**Typescript**

Typescript is a superset of JavaScript and brings a lot of nice to haves. My favorite is code completion.

**Koa**

There exists a lot of node webb server frameworks. Koa's aim is to be minimalistic and I therefore thought it would be 
a nice fit for this assignment.

**Axios**

A popular http client. I needed a framework that supported promises (nodes http module does not). So the choice was 
between Axios and node-fetch. I choose axios.

**Ava**

I am most used to jest. But for this particular case I thought that Ava could be a nice fit. Ava is very easy to set up 
and comes with a lot of nice features out of the box.
